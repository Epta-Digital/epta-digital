                <p>
                    Before reading further, it's imperative you first understand what the digital skill gap is. 
                    Digital skill game put simply, is the difference between the demand and supply of digital skills. 
                    In today's workspace, the demand for digital skills is improving. 
                    From being MS Office proficient, to being Adobe proficient, as well as the tons of other digital skills out there, 
                    more and more employers are increasingly asking their workers to perform tasks that require these skills. </p>
                
                <p>
                    But the truth is, these workers do not have these skills. And they do not or did not expect to be asked to use these skills. 
                    This leads to dissatisfaction and it's a serious hurdle most organizations are trying to jump past, because we're living in an age of digital transformation. 

                    Regardless, the digital skills gap needs to be filled. And that's the main reason why we should be talking about this skill gap. 
                    Talking creates awareness, and awareness leads to innovation, which leads to solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                     There are a couple of solutions people can take to fill the digital skill gap, and this includes but is not limited to </p>

                <p>
                    1.  <span class="bold red">TRAINING YOUR WORKFORCE:</span> <br>Yes, I know this might be a difficult task. But it's imperative that you understand the consequences of falling behind in this digital age. If other companies that are in competition with yours have better skilled staff than yours, or if your staff cannot meet up to the demands of your clients, this will affect your organization as a whole. Again, having workers who are highly skilled digitally would make your workflow more effective and efficient. Most organizations that don't have workers with digital skills end up outsourcing the work. This only incurs more cost and is ill advised in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. <span class="bold red">DIGITALLY SKILLED PEOPLE:</span>  <br>Increasing your workforce by hiring people who're both digitally skilled and can still provide the kind of service you require is a way of filling the digital skill gap in your organization. It's more efficient and if properly utilized, its the ideal solution. You can also hire other organizations that are specialized in providing digital services, like EPTA. This by far is the best solution, because of their specialization. Hiring a digital skill agency will ensure you get top notch service, for the ideal price, and you're assured of the quality. This type of organization is dedicated to filling the digital skill gap in the business industry, and should be used intensively.

                </p>
                <p class="bold">Conclusion</p>
                <p>
                    Talking more about the digital skills gap creates an awareness, not just of the problems caused by the digital skill gap, but of the solutions available. Utilizing organizations that specialize in filling this gap is a great way to jump that hurdle, but first, it's imperative to be aware of the problem.
